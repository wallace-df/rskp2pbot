  This bot will help you complete P2P transactions through RSK.

  Once you start up the Bot you can use the following commands:

  1. Publish your order using the /buy or /sell command and follow the instructions.

  2. Wait for another user to pick your request using the "Buy" or "Sell" buttons. You can also pick other users orders with these buttons!

  3. Your orders and reputation are visible in the ${channel} channel.

  4. If you are selling the bot will publish the order in the ${channel} channel in the expectance that another user takes the order. You can cancel this sell order anytime BEFORE another user takes it with the /cancel command.

  5. Once somebody takes your order the bot will ask you to lock your coins in a smart contract, such payment will be held, the order will expire in a maximum lapse of ${orderExpiration} minutes starting when the order was taken. The bot will reveal who the buyer is so you can send instructins for the FIAT payment to be made. Once you receive the FIAT payment you have to send funds to the buyer using the /release command.

  6. If you want to buy, you need to publish your order using the /buy command and wait until a seller takes it. You can cancel the order any time using the /cancel command.

  7. Once somebody takes your buying order you need to send your RBTC account address to the Bot, after that you need to contact your seller to get your FIAT payment instructions. Once you pay the seller should use the command /release, the BOT will send you a link to withdraw your coins.

  8. If you are taking a selling order , i.e. you buy, you must send your RBTC address to get your coins and ask the seller to give you the FIAT payment instructions. Once the seller receives the fiat payment he shall use the /release command to have the coins sent to your wallet.

  9. If you are taking a buy order, i.e. you sell coins, you must lock the coins in a smart contract, the coins will be held until the buyer makes the fiat payment. You must contact the buyer and give him the info needed to proceed with the fiat payment. Once you receive the fiat payment you must release the fund held by the smart contract, you must use the /release command and the buyer will be able to withdraw the coins.

  10. If at any stance you cannot carry out the trade, you can use this command /Dispute to call in admins to bring a solution as third parties. 

  11. Before any other user picks your order as a seller or buyer you can cancel such offer with the /cancel command. 

  12. If your order has been taken and you want to cancel, you can proceed with a cooperative cancellation if bth parties agree. you both should use /cancel command.

  Make a quick and safe transaction!
