start: |
  This bot will help you complete P2P transactions through RSK.

  Once you start up the bot:

  1. Publish your order using the /buy or /sell command and follow the instructions. 
  
  2. The bot will publish your order in the ${channel} channel so that other users can take it.

  3. You can cancel your order at any time BEFORE another user takes it by using the the /cancel command.

  4. When a buyer takes your sell order:
  
  4a. The bot will ask the buyer to provide the wallet address to receive the tokens. The buyer will have ${paymentWindow} minutes to inform the wallet address, or the order will be automatically cancelled and republished.

  4b. After the buyer provides the wallet address, the bot will ask you to lock tokens in a smart contract. The bot will charge you ${feePercent} on top of the order amount and you'll have ${paymentWindow} minutes to lock the tokens, or the order will be automatically cancelled and any locked tokens (including the fee) will be refunded to you.

  4c. Once the tokens are locked, the bot will reveal who the buyer is so that you send instructions to get your FIAT payment.

  4d. Once you receive the FIAT payment from the buyer, you must release the tokens from the smart contract.

  5. When a seller takes your buy order:

  5a. The bot will ask the seller to lock tokens in a smart contract. The seller will be charged ${feePercent} on top of the order amount and will have ${paymentWindow} minutes to lock the tokens, or the order will be automatically cancelled and republished. In this case, the seller will also get a refund on any locked tokens (including the fee).
  
  5b. Once the tokens are locked, the bot will put you in contact with the seller so that you can get the instructions to send the FIAT payment.
  
  5c. Once you make the FIAT payment, you should indicate that by using the /fiatsent command and wait for the seller to release the tokens to you.

  6. If at any stance you cannot carry out the trade, you can use the /dispute command to call in admins to bring a solution. 

  7. If your order has been taken and you want to cancel it, you can proceed with a cooperative cancellation (if both parties agree). You both should use /cancel command.

  Make a quick and safe transaction!
